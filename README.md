Project part of the course CSE 232B: Database System Implementation (University of California San Diego)

An XQuery Processor Engine that returns the result of the evaluation of an input Xquery.

Structure of Files and Folders:

1) pom.xml - an XML file that contains the information and configuration details used by Maven during the build process
2) gen/antlr4 - files generated by ANTLR4 for the 2 grammar files
3) input_data - contains the input files (XML and DTD)
4) output_data - the result of Xquery execution is written to this directory
5) rewritten_queries - directory containing the re-written Xqueries (part of Milestone 3)
6) src/main - 
   i) resources/antlr4 - contains the XPath and XQuery Grammar files
   ii) java/edu/ucsd/CSE232B/Milestone1 - files for Milestone 1 of the project
   iii) java/edu/ucsd/CSE232B/Milestone2 - files for Milestone 2 of the project
   iv) java/edu/ucsd/CSE232B/Milestone3 - files for Milestone 3 of the project
8) test_queries - input queries for Milestone 1 and 2
9) test_queries_for_optimization - input queries for Milestone 3

Milestone 1:
An XPath evaluator takes input data and XPath query and returns the result. The scope of grammar for this Milestone is limited to XPath.

Milestone 2:
For this Milestone, XQuery grammar extends the XPath grammar, and the input data remains the same for this Milestone. 

Milestone 3:
For this Milestone, the input XQuery is re-written using Join optimizations if it conforms to the subset of Xquery grammar that can be re-written. Further, execution is performed similarly to Milestone 2.

For all the 3 Milestones, we use the Visitor functions of ANTLR4, which visit the nodes in the abstract syntax tree created by parsing the input query as per the specified grammar rules.
